<h4>09/02/2022 <br> <p>Week 2:<br><br>On monday we started learning about machanical engineering. It has a lot of variations and I was really exited since this is the field I want to major in. Later on we learned about safety when working. On wednesday we started a project. We have to use three basic machanics in order to have a baseball pop a balloon. We will mainly be using cardbord for this project. We started designing our ideas on tinkercad. And lastely, today, friday, we took a 10 minute quiz on safety and did a challenge. We got to pick an object and design it on tinkercad. I am not a big fan of 3D design but this was still fun. <hr></p></h4>    
<h4>09/09/2022 <br> <p>Week 3:<br><br>This week we did not do much. We made sure that the websites worked and on Friday we learned how to properly use a ruler. We had to design an E with detailed dimentions writen and give those instructions to a partner who gave us their instructions. Then, we had to cut out the E as close to the dimentions as possible. It was an easy week so there is not much to write about.<hr></p></h4>    
<h4>09/16/2022 <br> <p>Week 4:<br><br> On monday, we got into groups of four and sketched our balloon projects on a peace of cardbord. It did not take long for my group to sketch so we were able to have fun and bond a little. The next class, wednesday, we started cutting out and taping our projects. Lets just say that everyone in my group, incuding me, is sloppy. It took a lot of attempts to get the pully to be strait. We were told that we would continue this on Friday so I took thick string with me to school and some one else brought a toy car. We ended up not continuing the project and did a challenge instead. This challenge was to make a paper boat that would stay up with weights. My group failed and our boat sank in less than a second. It was really fun but I am starting to question my engineering abilities.</p></h4>

<h4>09/23/2022 <br> <p>Week 5:<br><br>This week we continued working on our projects. My group needed some extra materials so I brought thick string and someone else brought a toy car. It was a very nice car. On wednesday we had to take the map test but the internet went down, as expected, so we continues working on our projects. My group got to test and we passed on the first try! Also, some kid that was not even from our class just came in while wearing cardboard. Overall, very fun week!</p></h4>

<h4>09/30/2022 <br> <p>Week 6:<br><br>We started learning about computer engineering. I was very surprized to realize that I had a strong interest in this field. Mr. Poole's friend gave us a presentation and it was very interesting. After the presentation, we got into groups and started disecting a laptop. My group took a while so we had to continue on friday. It was so intersting and fun! I really enjoyed it. We struggled a bit when putting everything back together but we somehow managed.</p></h4>

<h4>10/07/2022 <br> <p>Week7:<br><br>This week was bioengineering week. Personally, I hate biology and had very low expectations for this field of engineering. On monday, we were given a presentation on the topic and as time passed, I realized that bioengineering is actually very interesting. The idea of improving society by taking ideas from natural evolution really intrigued me. On wednesday, we were told to design a prostetic for an animal of our choice and an injury of our choice. I chose to work on a hedgehog with no hind legs. I used a simillar structure that was used on cats and dogs with a similar trauma. We had to make sure that the metirials would last long enough to actually be usefull so we had to research different materials. It was very fun but because I do not really enjoy biology, I will most likely not major in this branch of engineering.</p></h4>

<h4>10/13/2022<br><p>Week 8:<br><br>This week was aerospace engineering week. This is the field I want to go into so the slides were very interesting to me. Our project is to build a rocket so I got very exited but later found out that we will basically be making a plane since it will be flying horizontally. I was very disappointed since I actually do not like the idea of making planes. We started designing and I realized that I like to build instead of design. For the weekly challenge we had to make a flying paper that would touch a bin when throughn from the 2nd floor. I just made a paper plane but the people that got good results had crunpled their paper into a ball. </p></h4>

<h4>10/21/2022<br><p>Week 9:<br><br> This week we continued working on our rocket plains. This time we got to building and testing. I built the nozzle and back while my teammates built the wings. I would like to think we did a good job considering the time we had. On friday we started testing... no one's rocket really worked. Our rocket did three flips and went strait to the floor. I really enjoyed building the rocket and had fun with the project.</p></h4>

<h4>10/27/2022<br><p>Week 10:<br><br> We learned about environmental engineering. It was very interesting. They basically clean up the mess that the other engineers make. We also did a challenge. We had to predict how many candy corns would fit on a piece of paper. My group made an educational guess of 188. The answer was 226 I think. We also tried to filter water using rocks, sand, and tissue. My group's water was the second cleanest. </p></h4>

<h4>11/04/2022<br><p>Week 11:<br><br> We learned about electrical engineering. Electrical is one of my favorite branches of engineering. I love the diagrams and the math involved. We used Tinkedcad to make some breadboards. I made a small mistake with the grounding but I was able to fix it right away. Calculating the resistance is like a fun puzzle, I loved it. Electrical might have become a beckup major for me.</p></h4>

<h4>11/11/2022<br><p>Week 12:<br><br> We continued our lesson on electrical engineering. We used breadboards to make different cercuits like parallel, series, and even using a button. Me and my partner did very well with close to no mistakes. The only mistake that was made was with the button. At first we put the button wrong but after rotationg the butoon 90 degrees clockwise, our cercuit worked. We also did a challenge where we had to calculate what took less time, taking a 50 minute math class for 180 days or counting to a million. I did the ath and chose taking the math class which was the correct answer.</p></h4>

<h4>11/18/2022<br><p>Week 13:<br><br>We continued working on electrical engineering. This time, we learned how to code the pattern of the light. It was very interesting to try different patterns and get creative. For the challenge of the week we had to debate weather there are more wheeles or doors in the school. I was put on the side of doors. I tried prooving that books can count as doors and even ran to the library to find out how many books there are. My group won and I got a kitkat. </p></h4>

<h4>01/13/2023<br><p>Week 1:<br><br>This was the first week back. On monday we took it easy and after talking about our break, we played a kahoot that summerized what we learded about last semester. Afterwords we play the game where you have to guess the noun that was put on your forehead. The next two days we learned about buisness engineering. We had to come up with an idea of a product and present it to the class like in Shark Tank. My group decided to work on a website for students taking high math classes. We named it the Mathinator and I think we did a great job.</p></h4>

<h4>01/20/2023<br><p>Week 2:<br><br>This week, on wednesday, we finshed up with the presentations from last weeks buisness engineering lesson. After that we talked about chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is very broad and can be found anywhere. On friday, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a substance made out of corn starch and water (2:1). Oobleck is a solding when a lot of force is applyed and liquid when at rest. Me and my partner did great and we were told that our work was perfect.</p></h4>

<h4>01/27/2023<br><p>Week 3:<br><br>We had to choose a project to work on. Me and Linnea decided to work together. I wanted to do the arduino while she wanted to do the research project. That is why decided on a middle ground, the mousetrap car. We were given all of wednesday and friday to write a proposal. The proposal has to be a 5 page report where we have to do a lot of research on the mousetrap car. It was acctually very interesting doing my own research. I learned a lot and it made me realize that I do not need someone to teach me something, I can just learn it myself. </p></h4>

<h4>02/03/2023<br><p>Week 4:<br><br>This week we continued working on our mousetrap car projects. On monday we finished working on our proposels. we were told to perfect it before turning it in. We also had to turn in our Bill of Materials. On Wednesday we started working on 3D models of our projects. We continued this on friday and added measurements. We also did a challenge of trying to build the tallest towr of cards possible.</p></h4>

<h4>02/10/2023<br><p>Week 5:<br><br>We continued working on the mousetrap. it is still not redy since some metirials were missing but I think we can finish it by next week. We already have a good idea of what we are doing. On friday we mainly focused on the challenge. We had to use popsicle sticks and rabber bands to creat a busket. We would then place a water balloon on it and try to run without the balloon falling. Our group was first to lose.</p></h4>
