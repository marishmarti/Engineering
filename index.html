<h4>08/24/2022 <br> <p>This is my first blog for week 1. I hope this goes well.<br><br> On the 26th we played a game with the class. We were separeted into 2 teams and each team had nine rods and a marble. Whichever team dropped the marble into the basket first won. I think our team won but I am acctually not quite sure but it was fun and I really enjoyed it. <hr></p></h4>
