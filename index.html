<h4>08/24/2022 <br> <p>This is my first blog for week 1. I hope this goes well.<br><br>On monday we started learning about machanical engineering. It has a lot of variations and I was really exited since this is the field I want to major in. Later on we learned about safety when working. On wednesday we started a project. We have to use three basic machanics in order to have a baseball pop a balloon. We will mainly be using cardbord for this project. We started designing our ideas on tinkercad. And lastely, today, friday, we took a 10 minute quiz on safety and did a challenge. We got to pick an object and design it on tinkercad. I am not a big fan of 3D design but this was still fun. <hr></p></h4>
