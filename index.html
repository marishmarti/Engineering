<h4>09/02/2022 <br> <p>Week 2:<br><br>On monday we started learning about machanical engineering. It has a lot of variations and I was really exited since this is the field I want to major in. Later on we learned about safety when working. On wednesday we started a project. We have to use three basic machanics in order to have a baseball pop a balloon. We will mainly be using cardbord for this project. We started designing our ideas on tinkercad. And lastely, today, friday, we took a 10 minute quiz on safety and did a challenge. We got to pick an object and design it on tinkercad. I am not a big fan of 3D design but this was still fun. <hr></p></h4>    
<h4>09/09/2022 <br> <p>Week 3:<br><br>This week we did not do much. We made sure that the websites worked and on Friday we learned how to properly use a ruler. We had to design an E with detailed dimentions writen and give those instructions to a partner who gave us their instructions. Then, we had to cut out the E as close to the dimentions as possible. It was an easy week so there is not much to write about.<hr></p></h4>    
<h4>09/16/2022 <br> <p>Week 4:<br><br> On monday, we got into groups of four and sketched our balloon projects on a peace of cardbord. It did not take long for my group to sketch so we were able to have fun and bond a little. The next class, wednesday, we started cutting out and taping our projects. Lets just say that everyone in my group, incuding me, is sloppy. It took a lot of attempts to get the pully to be strait. We were told that we would continue this on Friday so I took thick string with me to school and some one else brought a toy car. We ended up not continuing the project and did a challenge instead. This challenge was to make a paper boat that would stay up with weights. My group failed and our boat sank in less than a second. It was really fun but I am starting to question my engineering abilities.</p></h4>

<h4>09/23/2022 <br> <p>Week 5:<br><br>This week we continued working on our projects. My group needed some extra materials so I brought thick string and someone else brought a toy car. It was a very nice car. On wednesday we had to take the map test but the internet went down, as expected, so we continues working on our projects. My group got to test and we passed on the first try! Also, some kid that was not even from our class just came in while wearing cardboard. Overall, very fun week!</p></h4>

<h4>09/30/2022 <br> <p>Week 6:<br><br>We started learning about computer engineering. I was very surprized to realize that I had a strong interest in this field. Mr. Poole's friend gave us a presentation and it was very interesting. After the presentation, we got into groups and started disecting a laptop. My group took a while so we had to continue on friday. It was so intersting and fun! I really enjoyed it. We struggled a bit when putting everything back together but we somehow managed.</p></h4>

<h4>10/07/2022 <br> <p>Week7:<br><br>This week was bioengineering week. Personally, I hate biology and had very low expectations for this field of engineering. On monday, we were given a presentation on the topic and as time passed, I realized that bioengineering is actually very interesting. The idea of improving society by taking ideas from natural evolution really intrigued me. On wednesday, we were told to design a prostetic for an animal of our choice and an injury of our choice. I chose to work on a hedgehog with no hind legs. I used a simillar structure that was used on cats and dogs with a similar trauma. We had to make sure that the metirials would last long enough to actually be usefull so we had to research different materials. It was very fun but because I do not really enjoy biology, I will most likely not major in this branch of engineering.</p></h4>

<h4>10/13/2022<br><p>Week 8:<br><br>This week was aerospace engineering week. This is the field I want to go into so the slides were very interesting to me. Our project is to build a rocket so I got very exited but later found out that we will basically be making a plane since it will be flying horizontally. I was very disappointed since I actually do not like the idea of making planes. We started designing and I realized that I like to build instead of design. For the weekly challenge we had to make a flying paper that would touch a bin when throughn from the 2nd floor. I just made a paper plane but the people that got good results had crunpled their paper into a ball. </p></h4>
